I got up at about 10 , lazed around for like an hour , and then went to the gym to make a subscription . 
I got there just as they were closing , but she let me in anyway , only to tell me that the 'ishur rofe ' I brought didn't say I could work out at the gym , so that she couldn't sign me up . 
It took me like 2 minutes to find in really small print on the second page that it actually did say I could work out . 
After that I came back home , did my laundry , and me and Zhenya my flatmate made supper and ate . 
Potatoes with creamed mushrooms and 'ktzitzot", in case you wanna know . 
Then I studied for a bit and watched some anime . 
I was supposed to go with Noa my neighbour to T-A to a party in the evening , but in the end it turned out she won't return to Haifa tomorrow morning , so I stayed here and went to the gym . 
In the gym I met Lots of people I know from the army ( and also N ' s husband : ) ) I ran for half an hour and worked on some exercise machines . 
And now I ' m here .
